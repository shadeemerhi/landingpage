# Landing Page Project

In this project, I utilized my JavaScript knowledge to add functionality to a webpage. The main areas explored were creating and modifying content as well as working with event listeners that would adjust content accordingly.

The main tasks that were done are:
1. Created a section of the webpage which matched the layout of the existing ones.
2. Added active state to the sections and navigation links that are in the viewport through highlighting.
3. Added scroll functionality to scroll to a section when a user clicks on the corresponding navigation link.
